## Building the network

Building the network is done in the file [NeuralNetwork.java](https://github.com/alintulu/NeuralNetwork/blob/master/src/neuralnetwork/NeuralNetwork.java). The method to do so is called `makeNetwork` and is called from the [main function](https://github.com/alintulu/NeuralNetwork/blob/master/src/neuralnetwork/NeuralNetwork.java#L104). The method takes three inputs.
