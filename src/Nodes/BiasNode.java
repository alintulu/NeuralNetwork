 * The bias is used to translate the separating hyperplane so that the 
 * function doesn't need to pass through the origin. 
 * The bias node is added to every non-input node and has a default output value
 * of 1.0. This way when the method getOutput() is called the bias node will
 * contribute with the value edge.weight * 1.0, i.e. the weight of the edge between
 * the non-input node and its associated bias node. This way the network does not
 * need a separate method to update the bias value, the value is automatically
 * updated when the method updateWeights() is called.
